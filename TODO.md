# CPU Scheduler Visualizer - Implementation Complete

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Implemented `show_explanations` Method
- **Location**: `cpu_scheduler_visualizer.py` - `SchedulerVisualizerApp` class
- **Functionality**: Creates a dialog window with step-by-step scheduling explanation
- **Features**:
  - Scrollable text area with dark theme
  - Chronological event display (arrivals, starts, ends)
  - Final process statistics summary
  - Close button for easy dismissal

### 2. Implemented `generate_explanation` Method
- **Purpose**: Generates detailed step-by-step explanation text
- **Algorithm Support**: Works with all scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority)
- **Event Types**:
  - Process arrivals
  - Execution starts
  - Execution completions
  - Context switches (for preemptive algorithms)

### 3. Integration with Existing UI
- **Button**: "Explanations" button in left panel (already existed)
- **Validation**: Checks if simulation has been run before showing explanations
- **Error Handling**: Shows warning if no data available

## ðŸ§ª Testing Notes
- Code has been successfully added to the application
- Syntax validation passed during edit
- Ready for user testing with different scheduling algorithms
- Should display clear, chronological explanations of scheduling decisions

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions
1. Configure processes and select an algorithm
2. Click "RUN" to execute simulation
3. Click "Explanations" button to view step-by-step breakdown
4. Review the chronological events and final statistics
5. Close the explanation window when done

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Delivered
- **Educational Value**: Helps users understand how scheduling algorithms work
- **Visual Learning**: Complements Gantt chart with textual explanations
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Shows all timing events and decisions
- **User-Friendly**: Clean interface matching the app's dark theme
